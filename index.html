 <p id="Title">My 2 week Challenge</p>
 <p id="declarations">By: L. Chung<br>Teacher: Sarah Harvala</p>
 <div id="block1">My challenge is to learn JavaScript and to create and maintain this website. Here are the guidelines I set for my self:<br><br>1. By the 10th of September, my goal is to create a functional website, complete with interactable features that showcase what I have learned. <br><br>2. I should be well versed in the basic of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong> (HTML is the structure of the website, CSS is the design of the website, and Javascript will allow me to make the website more interactable).<br><br> I undertook this challenging because it was very demanding, and I think it will open more future opportunities. I hope to implement the knowledge I learn into practical use in these 10 days. This challenge will definitely will make me want to peel my eyes out at some point. On top of that, doing is the best way to learn, and this could serve as a very good lesson in the future.<br> Lastly, for my expectations, I expect a website that showcases the things I learned in an interactable demonstration format or as a visual alongside a very descriptive interpretation of what is happening and what I have learned.</div>
 
 <p id="act1">I</p>
 
 
 <div class="container">
   <div class="centered-content">

 <div id="block2">I decided that the best place to start is Youtube, and decided my first mini project was to learn how to set up this website and make it organized. I only had around 30 minutes of time today, so I decided to set up a simple and clean design. Furthermore I noticed that googling how to do things is a particularly big part of the process of learning. There is just so much to keep up with, and trying to learn all of them at once isn't proving successful, but at the end of the day "coding teaches the mind to view problems from different perspectives and think creatively about solving them.", and if there is anything I have learned, it is that problems reoccur, but solutions almost always vary from time to time (Parachute.net).</div>
 
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <button class="drop1">Birthday Script (hover over me)</button>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>This code can be used to make a simple birthday song in the console panel.<br><br>startProgram<br><br>function startProgram(){let username = "x";<br>let age = 21;<br><br>happyBirthday();<br>}<br><br> function happyBirthday(){<br>console.log("Happy birthday to you!);<br>console.log("Happy birthday to you!);<br>console.log("Happy birthday dear", x);<br>console.log("Happy birthday to you!);<br>console.log("You are", age,"years old!"); But if you want to have the user input their information then you can just hook the variables to a window prompt.</p>
  </div>
</div>
 </div>
 
 <p id="act2">II</p>
 
 <div id="block3">Today was not very productive at all because I was busy tying all my loose ends with the math test, herbarium, and homework. On top of that, I procrastinated when I had the time to learn, but in the end, I forced myself to learn a little bit about loops and functions. I also learned how to set up this website on the internet, and it was surprisingly easy. "Coding allows kids to express their new ideas more colourfully and create something worthwhile." Once you realise that the only thing stopping you from creating virtually anything you want is your gap in experience, then you also realise that programming can be taught, but creativity cannot (JETlearn). On a side note, this kind of made me realise that coding in JavaScript isn't massively difficult, I am just incomprehensibly bad at it and that's really what makes any improvement or progress that much better!</div>

<p id="act3">III</p>

<div id="block4">Today the project slipped out of mind, but I decided to learn a little bit about colors and animations. The complete list of attributes is highly exhaustive and extremely finicky, but very rewarding. I decided to make the background have a breath like animation that will make the reader feel slightly paranoid that they are seeing things.</div>

<p id="act4">IV</p>



<div class="container1">
 <div class="centered-content1">
<div id="block5">I decided that right after school I would start learning about general web design and also start noting down design concepts. Today I started noticing that I had subconsciously started thinking about how the web developers did what they did on every website I visited. I think this is a very applicable process for most subjects. For example, when you go to a store, what makes you buy certain products over others? Maybe one of the products has a more pleasing color or maybe you like it more because it is at eye level or maybe it's a more reputable or maybe cheap brand. All these factors that come into play are very intriguing to me, and the amount of thought that may have gone into some of these fine details that most people glance over is crazy. I may have gone on a little bit of a tangent, but I suggest you (supposedly Sarah) and anyone else who might come across this page to consider this mindset, perhaps you will find a new appreciation for the small things in your everyday life. On a side note, after exploring hours' worth of webpages and JavaScript information, I have decided that my next mini project will be a grid showcasing multiple different colors and different filters that can be placed on top of them to give them a unique look. </div></div>
<div class="dropdown1">
  <button class="drop2">
    Filter Grid <br>(hover over me)
    </button>
  <div class="dropdown-content1">
    
    <div class="filter" id="filter1">1</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter2">2</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter3">3</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter4">4</div>
    <div id="filter5" class="filter">5</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter6">6</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter7">7</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter8">8</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter9">9</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter10">10</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter11">11</div>
    <div class="filter" id="filter12">12</div>
  </div>
  </div>
  </div>




<p id="act5">V</p>



<div class="container2">
  <div id="centered-content2">
    <div id="block6">If you noticed that the button led to a set of numbers, that means I didn't succeed in figuring out how to set it up. Trying to figure out how to divide the dropdown into 12 rectangular parts was the issue. No matter how many web forums, videos, official documents, and even AI, I still don't think CSS allows a way to do such a thing. I predicted that I would get immensely frustrated at the start, but even though the mini project didn't work out, I did learn a couple of things. <br><br>1. Organizing your code becomes essential the more objects you put into your project.<br><br>2. When you have an idea you want to recreate, you have to first visualize it, then divide it into stages, and lastly figure out how you're going to execute it. <br><br> These rules are very applicable to real life as well and this failure will stand as a testament to effort or maybe overcomplication. I've done my due research and, quite similar to a rabbit hole, the fields and concepts to learn just keep on going. Since my last endeavor didn't work out, I figure my next one could be a collage of different types of input, like buttons and maybe sliders to showcase the variety of CSS and challenge myself to learn how to implement them properly.</div> </div>
    <div class="dropdown2">
      <button id="drop3">
        Input Gallery (hover over me)
      </button>
      <div class="dropdown-content2">
        These are the 22 inputs in HTML.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
<p id="act6">VI</p>

<div id="block7">I skipped this day mostly intentionally and didn't really have the motivation to learn about JS, but I did learn about how websites like Amazon work as well as how computers work out of pure curiosity. While on a trail, I did think about how different programming is from other hobbies/subjects in the way that you can't really envision the result of your input. In short, programming is a set of instructions that you give in the hopes of a functional product (input/output). This makes it hard to practice while not in the right environment. In conclusion, programming is very dependent on whether or not you have all you need.</div>

<p id="act7">VII</p>

 <div id="block8">Today I worked a bit on the "input" mini project. I counted at least 20 unique ways to input information, and I came up with dozens of different CAPTCHA tests. A CAPTCHA test is used to verify if the user is a human or not, and there are many reasons why this is important in security. For example, if you don't want bots bombarding your server with requests, then one of the easiest ways is to not allow them onto your servers. Secondly, if information is confidential, I am sure you wouldn't want unauthorized people to access it. The whole idea of finding unique, simple, and practical tests to trifle robots and allow humans to pass through is so fascinating to me, especially with the rise in technology and AI getting more and more capable. Without getting more sidetracked, I'd say my main takeaway is that I found that UX (User Experience) is what fascinates me and the stuff that really challenges me to learn more. This was also the day that I started to test different types of animations on different boxes and text models.</div>

<p id="act8">VIII</p>

<div id="block9">I deemed it was worth getting to know all the tools I have and all the capabilities I have. Today I ventured into text editors and HTML and CSS - the languages normally used to create websites, for they are technically "mark-up languages". While they are somewhat alike and look very similar, programming is basically to solve problems and create software, for example, a video game. Videogames can't really be made on HTML or CSS, and to make a game you don't necessarily need HTML or CSS, but to advertise and add a download website, you need them. Either way, my challenge is still ongoing as I still have JavaScript to learn, which funnily enough is actually classified as a "scripting" language. Thus, this whole challenge is kind of comparable to me trying to learn how to cook with a hammer and a rock. JavaScript can still be used to make software like games and even AI that I could program to fight itself, and regardless of this minor discovery, I still believe that I can learn and create as I would with any other language. On top of some research, I kept getting more and more ideas, for example, a finances tracker or a weather app, or a Flappy Bird clone. In the end, I believe everyone should learn the basics of programming and mark-up languages to not only learn how to automate certain mundane processes but also develop a mindset towards creating. That's not just my own opinion take this excerpt from Berkeley's official website, "Versatile workers are often held in high regard, and learning a programming language can make an employee more valuable and lead to more job opportunities." I completely agree that programming is a very stable and fortuitous career path and even outside of careers, it applies to some hobbies (Berkeley). I did work on the website a little, learning about different ways I could do the same thing and what was best for each individual situation.</div>

<p id="act9">IX</p>

<div id="block10">I've been getting sidetracked by this book called "Rich Dad Poor Dad" a book about finance that has left a lasting impression, and I wholeheartedly recommend reading it and hunting for the meaning of some of things the book has to offer and trying to absorb the stuff it has in it. The reason I brought this up is because programming is quite literally the future, and there's a line in the book that is repeated both in the book and by the author "Robert Kiyosaki" many times. The saying is "Rich don't work for money, money works for me", and it really had me thinking about how I shouldn't be programming to program, but as a tool so that I can do other things. I started learning more about JavaScript and its syntax (basically the rules by which the language operates. Syntax is kind of akin to punctuation), I noticed some odd nuances, for example "when inputting "2 + 2" the output is 4, but when you change the number into a string, then the result becomes 22, but when subtracting strings from one another, then they weirdly were converted into numbers". I really wanted to create a rudimentary calculator, especially as a last miniproject and test of skill. This whole website challenge so far has given me so much appreciation for not only marketing, but also the worldwide applications, and I can clearly see why technology dominates the modern world, for better or for worse.</div>

 <h1> Calculator Program in JavaScript </h1>
<div class= "formstyle">
<form name = "form1">
<input id = "calc" type ="text" name = "answer"> <br> <br>
  <input type = "button" value = "1" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '1' ">
  <input type = "button" value = "2" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '2' ">

  <input type = "button" value = "-" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '-' ">
  <br> <br>
    <input type = "button" value = "7" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '7' ">
  <input type = "button" value = "8" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '8' ">
  <input type = "button" value = "9" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '9' ">
  <input type = "button" value = "*" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '*' ">
  <br> <br>
  <input type = "button" value = "/" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '/' ">
  <input type = "button" value = "0" onclick = "form1.answer.value += '0' ">
    <input type = "button" value = "." onclick = "form1.answer.value += '.' ">
    <!-- When we click on the '=' button, the onclick() shows the sum results on the calculator screen. -->
  <input type = "button" value = "=" onclick = "form1.answer.value = eval(form1.answer.value) ">
  <br>
  <!-- Display the Cancel button and erase all data entered by the user. -->
  <input type = "button" value = "Clear All" onclick = "form1.answer.value = ' ' " id= "clear" >
  <br>
    
</form>
</div>
 

<p id="act10">X</p>
<div id="block11">Today marked the last day to work on the challenge and I wanted to end it off by not only trying to learn even more about JavaScript but by adding something special that I would remember forever. I knew I was very restricted by my skills and experience, but after a much thought, I settled on a simple game. A "Rock, Paper, Scissors" copy, but I didn't know how I was going to program the opponent or how to even make the game. I knew I wasn't skilled enough to send server packets to a server, and asking for it's choice and having the information be constantly refreshed, but I reckoned that I was probably able to create a computer that randomly chooses a choice based on a RNG. Perhaps the computer should base their decisions from pattern recognition or human behavior, although that seems way out of my line of expertise, and I currently have no knowledge about human behavior or training computers with processed feedback. I figured it was best to dive head first into the problem and solve the rest later. I started by assigning all the possible choices with all the possible endings. I then set the setup the counter and ending screens. A very primal way of doing it, as the computer has no choice to try and alter the pattern to trick the player. This creation turned out to be so cool, and the desire to create something more interactive would lead me to continue programming even after this challenge is over. I would love to get into 3D modeling, backend serverside stuff, and maybe even try creating a little racing game if I get better at programming. Although if I had to choose then, I would prefer to stick with web development. Ultimately, this challenge has taught me more about statistics and these tree-like data structures, but I figure I could have done a little better if I had put more planning into this.</div>

<section class="game">
        <!--Title -->
      
          
          <!--Display Score of player and computer -->
        <div class="score">
            <div class="playerScore">
                <h2>Player</h2>
                <p class="p-count count">0</p>
  
            </div>

          <!--Number of moves left before game ends -->
        <div class="movesleft">Moves Left: 10 </div>

            <button class="paper">Paper</button>
            <button class="scissor">Scissors</button>
        </div>
          
          <!--Final result of game -->
        <div class="result"></div>
          
          <!--Reload the game -->
        <button class="reload"></button>
  
    </section>
<div id="MORTAR">Now while this program isn't the most sophisticated in the way that it tries to predict human nature, and I definitely could have made the game look more aesthetic, but I couldn't get anything to properly work. There were just too many moving parts, but anyway this is a proof of concept and I'd say this was a partial success.</div>
<div id="conclusion"><span class="strong">Conclusion</span><br><br>In conclusion, on the first day of September, I attempted to learn JS and create a website using it. In the process, I created multiple mini projects, such as the calculator or the input gallery which displayed what I had apprehended throughout the 10 days. I wasn't always the most motivated, but the things I learned along the way added up. I will definitely program again if I have the opportunity. This challenge not only taught me numerous programming concepts but also gave me a new perspective on how to think about marketing and stores. I highly recommend programming to Sarah or anybody else, as it can be very useful and on top of that, it allows you to be much more tech literate, a skill that is undeniably growing in demand in today's day and age. </div>
